Through the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and up the sweeping
drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what was fast becoming a
gale. Leaning against the window, Harry could see Hogwarts coming nearer, its
many lighted windows blurred and shimmering behind the thick curtain of rain.
Lightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a halt before the great
oak front doors, which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps. People who had
occupied the carriages in front were already hurrying up the stone steps into the
castle. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville jumped down from their carriage and
dashed up the steps too, looking up only when they were safely inside the
cavernous, torch-lit entrance hall, with its magnificent marble staircase.
"Blimey," said Ron, shaking his head and sending water everywhere, "if that keeps
up the lake's going to overflow. I'm soak - ARRGH!"

A large, red, water-filled balloon had dropped from out of the ceiling onto Ron's
head and exploded. Drenched and sputtering, Ron staggered sideways into Harry,
just as a second water bomb dropped - narrowly missing Hermione, it burst at
Harry's feet, sending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into his socks. People
all around them shrieked and started pushing one another in their efforts to get out
of the line of fire. Harry looked up and saw, floating twenty feet above them,
Peeves the Poltergeist, a little man in a bell-covered hat and orange bow tie, his
wide, malicious face contorted with concentration as he took aim again.
"PEEVES!" yelled an angry voice. "Peeves, come down here at ONCE!"

Professor McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress and head of Gryffindor House, had
come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded on the wet floor and grabbed
Hermione around the neck to stop herself from falling.
